# Vaani: Voice as an interface
Coming Soon. âŒ›âŒ›ðŸ¥º

Vaani is a platform that enables users to share their voice (securely, and anonymously) across media, and channels. It leverages existing technology built for various platforms, and aims to be only the interface for recording and sharing.

Actions speak louder than words, but until we can figure out how to record actions and share them, LET'S TALK!    
So come on and talk to me baby!
